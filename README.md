This project is for testing GitLab and GitHub behaviors.  It exists at
both
[@OpenTechStrategies/test](https://github.com/OpenTechStrategies/test)
(on GitHub) and [ots/test](https://code.librehq.com/ots/test) (on our
GitLab instance).

We try (admittedly in a somewhat desultory fashion) to keep the
repository itself in sync between the forges, because it's useful to
compare things like Markdown rendering.  However, the issue tracker
tickets are not kept in sync, because there's neither a mechanism for
nor a purpose to doing so.

Any member of Open Tech Strategies should have write access on all
forges where this project exists.  If you are a member but are missing
write access somewhere, please [contact us in Zulip
chat](https://chat.opentechstrategies.com/#narrow/stream/2-general/topic/svn).
